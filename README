Scalog tries to implement the Prolog language (based on the tuProlog Project: http://alice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Tuprolog/) into Scala sourcefiles.
For further information on how to write Scalog code, consult one of the examples in the folder 'examples' or have 
a look at the german documentation provided in this repo (english version is in progress).

How to compile Scalog.
***********************
You need the libraries of the tuProlog project (link above). Make sure that this libs are in your classpath.
Furthermore, you need to compile Predef.scala and Scalog.scala. The Predef is linked with every Scalog document,
so be sure to have it in your classpath when you try to compile a Scalog file.

Compiling Scalog files.
***********************
For compiling a Scalog file you just have to run the command
scala scalog.Scalog <SourceFile> <DestFile>

Then you can compile your DestFile into a classfile
scalac <DestFile>

Now you are able to run your Scalog code.
For further instructions see the documentation.
