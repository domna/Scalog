Scalog is an approach of implementing the Prolog language (based on the tuProlog Project: http://alice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Tuprolog/) in scala source code.
For further information on writing Scalog code you can consult one of the examples in the folder 'examples' or have 
a look at the german documentation provided in this repo (english version is in progress).

How to compile Scalog.
***********************
You'll need the libraries of the tuProlog project (as linked above). Make sure that your classpath contains these librarys.
Furthermore you'll need to compile Predef.scala and Scalog.scala.
Every Scalog source file is linked with the Predef file. Assure that your classpath contains this file.

Compiling Scalog files.
***********************
To compile a Scalog file you can use the following command
scala scalog.Scalog <SourceFile> <DestFile>

After this you can compile your destination file DestFile into a class file
scalac <DestFile>

Now you should be able to run your Scalog code directly by referring to your class name.
For further instructions you should consult the documentation.
