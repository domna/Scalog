Scalog trys to implement the Prolog language (Based on the tuProlog Project: http://alice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Tuprolog/) inside of Scala sourcefiles.
For further information how to write Scalog code consulte one of the examples in the folder 'Beispiele' or have 
a look at the german documentation provided in this repo (english version is in progress).

How to compile Scalog.
***********************
You need the librarys of the tuProlog project (link above). Make sure that this libs are in your classpath.
Further you just need to compile Predef.scala and Scalog.scala. The Predef is linked by every Scalog document
so be sure to have it in your classpath when you try to compile a Scalog file.

Compiling Scalog files.
***********************
To compile a Scalog file you just have to run the command
scala scalog.Scalog <SourceFile> <DestFile>

then you can compile your DestFile into a classfile
scalac <DestFile>

now your able to run your Scalog code.
For further instructions see the documentation.
